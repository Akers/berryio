// -------------------- CONTRIBUTING CODE TO BERRYIO ------------------------

BerryIO is hosted on the GitHub project hosting and collaboration service
here: https://github.com/NeonHorizon/berryio

To contribute code to the BerryIO project you need to have a github account
and have BerryIO installed and working. Using git is quite complicated so I
have included some instructions below to help you get you started. Basically
you need to make your changes in /usr/share/berryio and put them in a git
branch and then upload them to github.

// Go into the BerryIO program directory
cd /usr/share/berryio/

// Make sure your RaspberryPi git settings are configured if you haven't
// done so already, be sure to change Fred Bloggs and the email address to
// your details!
sudo git config --global user.name 'Fred Bloggs'
sudo git config --global user.email 'test@test.com'

// Make sure BerryIO is up to date with github
sudo git pull origin master

// Then create your code branch, be sure to change my_code to something
// appropriate
sudo git checkout -b my_code

// Now make any changes you wish to make to the code and test

// Add your changed files into the staging area
sudo git add .

// Commit your changed files, be sure to set a sensible description of
// your changes
sudo git commit -m 'My code changes which are great'

// Push your changes to github, be sure to change my_code to the branch
// name you used above
sudo git push origin my_code

If you did everything correctly I will then review your code branch
and maybe incorporate it into the next release!
