// ------------------------ SECURITY INFORMATION -------------------------

BerryIO is not designed to be accessed over the internet or an insecure
environment. Although it is password protected it is not encrypted so a
malicious attacker could snoop on your password. If you wish to access
BerryIO over the internet you should at the very least encrypt the web
interface with SSL/https security which you can do by changing the
configuration in the file /etc/apache2/sites-available/berryio. Please
consult the Apache manual for more details.


// --------------------------- WIRING THE LCD ----------------------------

Please refer to the config file /etc/berryio/lcd.php for instructions on
wiring a HDD44780 or KS0066U compatible LCD display. This included options
for changing which GPIO ports you wish to connect the display to.


// ------------------------ UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS ------------------------

// IMPORTANT: You need a working internet connection to upgrade BerryIO

// Make sure your distribution is up to date
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

// Run the upgrade script
// (NOTE: This replaces /etc/berryio/menu.php so if you have made any
// changes you will need to re-apply them)
sudo ./upgrade.sh

// If you have a new revision 2 board (including 512MB version) you can
// adjust /etc/berryio/gpio.php manually or copy in the new config file
sudo cp config/etc/berryio/gpio.php /etc/berryio/gpio.php
